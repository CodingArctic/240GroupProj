                <p class="pg">UNIX, first developed in the 1960s, is a multi-user operating system that allows more than one person to use a computer’s resources at a time. This operating system allows direct communication with a computer via a terminal, which causes it to be very interactive and it gives the user direct control over the computer resources. An additional feature that UNIX has gives users the ability to share data and programs with one another.</p>
